* Prereq
** DONE Figure out rust+emacs
        https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/4jbx7m/fancy_rust_development_with_emacs/

* Documentation
** TODO Document ispcrt.
** TODO Add more metadata to ispcrt's Cargo.toml
** DONE #![deny(missing_docs)] the ispc library
** DONE be sure to comment default values

* Functionality
** TODO Make ispc generate include file dependencies with -MMM and make them trigger recompilation.

* README
** TODO Upload docs to github
** TODO Steal layout of iobuf library
** TODO link to ispc homepage
** TODO Walkthrough the demo code
** TODO How to view warnings and performance warnings (sucks!)
** TODO include pretty picture!
** TODO environment variable overrides
** TODO compile time requirements
** TODO talk about multi-targeting

* Testing
** TODO travis-ci script for linux tests (see: iobuf)
** TODO appveyor for windows tests (see: gcc-rs)
** TODO test weird configs to make sure they work. Maybe need ispc-test binary?
** TODO test alternate math libraries
** DONE test tasking

* Targets
** TODO ispc technically supports NEON (only in HEAD?). look into it.
** TODO Add support for xeon phi. Hard (for me) to test.

* Tasking
** TODO Allow custom pluggable tasking systems, instead of a generic ispcrt
** DONE Port or copy in the c++ based tasking library from ispc/examples.
        Pthreads with an oversubscription feature seems fine for this.
        https://github.com/ispc/ispc/blob/master/examples/tasksys.cpp

* Performance
** TODO Respect $NUM_JOBS. Does that even make sense? Might have to ask in IRC for
        this one.
** TODO Add instrumentation support.
** TODO Can I detect the debug-assertations flag at build.rs time?
        If so, use it to detect a sane value for `--opt=disable-assertations`
