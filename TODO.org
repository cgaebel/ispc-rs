* Documentation
  [ ] #![deny(missing_docs)] the ispc library
  [ ] be sure to comment default values

* README
  [ ] Upload docs to github
  [ ] Steal layout of iobuf library
  [ ] link to ispc homepage
  [ ] Walkthrough the demo code
  [ ] How to view warnings and performance warnings (sucks!)
  [ ] include pretty picture!
  [ ] environment variable overrides
  [ ] compile time requirements
  [ ] talk about multi-targeting

* Testing
  [ ] travis-ci script for linux tests (see: iobuf)
  [ ] appveyor for windows tests (see: gcc-rs)
  [ ] test weird configs to make sure they work. Maybe need ispc-test binary?
  [ ] test alternate math libraries
  [ ] test tasking

* Targets
  [ ] ispc technically supports NEON (only in HEAD?). look into it.
  [ ] Add support for xeon phi. Hard to test.

* Tasking
  [ ] Port or copy in the c++ based tasking library from ispc/examples. Maybe
      use rust's task abstraction? Does rust even _have_ a task abstraction?
